# AVL-MAP
**map implementation using  AVL tree**
Search operation in the map implemented with the **AVL tree**  is faster than  the **inbuilt map**, which is implemented using the **red-black tree**.
Implemented rotations like **left-left** rotation, **left-right** rotation, **right-left** rotation, and **right-right** rotation. 
Implemented **lower-bound**, **upper-bound**, **find**, **delete**, and **insert**  functions  on  the AVL tree.
